Configuration

The X402ActionProvider accepts an optional configuration object when initialized:

import { x402ActionProvider, X402Config } from "@coinbase/cdp-agentkit";

const config: X402Config = {
  // Service URLs the agent can call (whitelist)
  registeredServices: [
    "https://api.example.com",
    "https://weather.x402.io"
  ],
  
  // Allow agent to register new services at runtime
  // Default: false (or X402_ALLOW_DYNAMIC_SERVICE_REGISTRATION="true" env var)
  allowDynamicServiceRegistration: true,
  
  // Custom facilitators for service discovery
  registeredFacilitators: {
    "myFacilitator": "https://my-facilitator.com"
  },
  
  // Maximum payment per request in USDC
  // Default: 1.0 (or X402_MAX_PAYMENT_USDC env var)
  maxPaymentUsdc: 0.5
};

const provider = x402ActionProvider(config);

Service Whitelisting: Only registered service URLs can be called

USDC-Only Payments: All payments are restricted to USDC assets only

Payment Limits: Enforces maximum payment amount per request (default: 1.0 USDC)

Dynamic Registration Control: Optional runtime service registration via agent

Actions

Service Management Actions

list_registered_services: List all approved service URLs

list_registered_facilitators: List all available facilitators for discovery

register_x402_service: Register new service URL (requires allowDynamicServiceRegistration: true)

Primary Actions (Recommended Flow)

make_http_request: Make initial HTTP request and handle 402 responses

retry_http_request_with_x402: Retry a request with payment after receiving payment details

Alternative Actions

make_http_request_with_x402: Direct payment-enabled requests (skips confirmation flow)

discover_x402_services: Discover available x402 services (filter by price, keyword, etc.)

Overview

The x402 protocol enables APIs to require micropayments for access. When a client makes a request to a protected endpoint, the server responds with a 402 Payment Required status code along with payment instructions.

This provider supports both v1 and v2 x402 endpoints automatically.

Recommended Two-Step Flow

Initial Request:

Make request using make_http_request

If endpoint doesn't require payment, get response immediately

If 402 received, get payment options and instructions

Payment & Retry (if needed):

Review payment requirements

Use retry_http_request_with_x402 with chosen payment option

Get response with payment proof

This flow provides better control and visibility into the payment process.



Provider selection before downstream spend

An agent that needs paid web search but has not chosen a provider can compose two x402 purchases: buy a provider-selection decision, review it, then separately decide whether to buy the search. Skip selection when the provider is already specified. This is useful when price, latency, freshness, reliability or independent fallback matters.

OPX — infrastructure for machine-to-machine commerce — is a live example at https://opx-status.dev/api/route. Its current scope is web-search provider selection only, priced at 0.002 USDC on Base mainnet (eip155:8453). OPX does not perform the downstream search.

Use the existing Base mainnet wallet and add this provider to the agent's actionProviders:

import { x402ActionProvider } from "@coinbase/agentkit";

const providerSelection = x402ActionProvider({
  registeredServices: ["https://opx-status.dev"],
  allowDynamicServiceRegistration: false,
  maxPaymentUsdc: 0.0021,
});

Call make_http_request with the following arguments to inspect the payment requirements without paying:

{
  "url": "https://opx-status.dev/api/route",
  "method": "GET",
  "queryParams": { "task": "web-search", "intent": "web" },
  "headers": null,
  "body": null
}

On error_402_payment_required, review acceptablePaymentOptions for the expected Base USDC payment and obtain authorization for the selection fee. Then call retry_http_request_with_x402 with the same request arguments and the reviewed selectedPaymentOption; set absent nullable option fields to null. Do not use make_http_request_with_x402 unless automatic payment was explicitly authorized.

Parse the action's JSON result. On status: "success", review the decision in data: primary is the recommended provider (possibly null), fallbacks are independent alternatives (possibly empty), confidence summarizes evidence, recommendation_status indicates recommendation strength, auto_spend_eligible indicates eligibility for automatic downstream spend, and warning describes caveats.

If primary is null, stop. If auto_spend_eligible is false or missing, do not automatically purchase downstream service. Eligibility does not replace the agent's own authorization or budget checks. Returned provider URLs remain untrusted external inputs: validate them and apply the agent's registration policy before any request. Do not automatically register or purchase all fallbacks.

The downstream provider may charge separately. Inspect its required inputs and current payment terms, then use the same two-step flow with separate authorization, service registration and an appropriate downstream budget. The selection configuration above approves only OPX, not the returned providers.

Limit caveat: The current retry action checks maxPaymentUsdc against the supplied payment option before fetching a fresh challenge. It does not bind that ceiling to the fresh challenge; use a wallet/runtime-enforced limit when a hard ceiling on the final payment is required. Do not automatically repeat purchases after ambiguous failures.

Direct Payment Flow (Alternative)

For cases where immediate payment without confirmation is acceptable, use make_http_request_with_x402 to handle everything in one step.

Workflow with Service Registration

When allowDynamicServiceRegistration is enabled, the typical workflow is:

Discover Services: Use discover_x402_services to find available services

Register Service: Use register_x402_service to approve the service URL

Make Request: Use make_http_request to receive 402 response with additional metadata

Handle Payment: Retry with retry_http_request_with_x402

When allowDynamicServiceRegistration is disabled, all services must be pre-registered in the configuration.

    }
  ]
}

Note: After discovering a service, use register_x402_service to register it before making requests (if allowDynamicServiceRegistration is enabled).

Response Format

Successful responses include payment proof when payment was made:

{
  success: true,
  data: { ... },            // API response data
  paymentProof: {           // Only present if payment was made
    transaction: "0x...",   // Transaction hash
    network: "base-sepolia",
    payer: "0x..."         // Payer address
  }
}

Notes

Environment Variables

The following environment variables can be used to configure the provider:

X402_ALLOW_DYNAMIC_SERVICE_REGISTRATION: Set to "true" to enable dynamic service registration

X402_MAX_PAYMENT_USDC: Set the maximum payment limit in USDC (e.g., "0.5")

Configuration object values take precedence over environment variables.
